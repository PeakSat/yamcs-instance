    In order to do this, we must first convert all ascii numbers to decimal form.
    Also we need to keep track of the space characters. If we receive numbers one after the other
    (whithout space characters in between), we need to multiply the previous entry by 10, in order
    to parse the whole decimal.

        If the debugging messages are altered, this script will have undetermined behavior, since
